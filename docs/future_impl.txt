Actually, the way the system should work right now, it uses the text from the files, the raw folder within the data, which is right, this is good, but we need to get the client ID from the database. Every time that the scraper scrapes, it appends a new record to the scraping logs and the scraped pages. The scraping logs will have the log ID, the client ID, it will have source URL scraped, it will have a lot of information. What we need to do is, we're going to get the text that we're extracting the number from, it's going to be in the files as it is now, which is good, but we also need to check to see the corresponding scraped log and possibly the scraped pages. I think just for now, have it check the scraped logs, it's actually called scraping underscore logs table, and look for the URL underscore scraped column, which will have the URL. That URL should correspond to the URL that we find in the raw. If we go to, I think at the moment, there's a slight issue with,

we need to implement a run Identifier and perhaps a description something to inlude start to finish throught the tables.
